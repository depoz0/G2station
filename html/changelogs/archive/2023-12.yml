  Fikou:
  - rscadd: turns triple ai mode into a station trait
  Jacquerel:
  - rscadd: Agent IDs once more trick Beepsky into treating you more leniently.
  - rscadd: Prisoner IDs make Beepsky treat you somewhat more suspiciously, as do
      Syndicate IDs. Wearing a Centcomm ID means that Beepsky is aware that you are
      above the law.
  - rscadd: Player-controlled security bots can view someone's assessed threat level
      by examining them.
  MidoriWroth:
  - bugfix: Icebox chemistry lab shutters are controlled by the button in the chemistry
      lab and not in the pharmacy again.
  Pickle-Coding:
  - code_imp: The singularity processing is a bit more important than the other subsystems.
  TJatPBnJ:
  - bugfix: Changelings will no longer get an objective to impersonate crew without
      absorbable DNA.
  - bugfix: Changelings will no longer start without an escape objective.
  Thlumyn:
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now get wings from flight potions.
  Vermidia:
  - spellcheck: fixed typo in one of spacer's moodlets
  - rscadd: Heterochromatic, Signer, Spacer, and Voracious quirks are now properly
      accounted for in medical records.
  jlsnow301:
  - rscadd: Added a new modular bitrunning domain - Starfront Saloon.
  - balance: Psyker shuffle domain was made slightly easier and has been given more
      rewards.
  mc-oofert:
  - bugfix: shield wall gens actually use power now
  - qol: shield wall gens may now be rebuilt and use some balloon alerts, and have
      wiring
  san7890:
  - balance: The Meat Hook will now "ground" you whenever you fire it out at someone.
      You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which "upgrades" to
      a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom and start to drag it
      in.
  - bugfix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat hooks.
  - bugfix: Meat hooks should no longer play the "magical gun" suicide if you were
      to use it, but instead do their own unique thing.
